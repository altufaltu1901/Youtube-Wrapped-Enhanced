# Youtube-Wrapped-Enhanced
YouTube Wrapped Analytics with LLM & RAG
Project Description
This project lets you analyze your YouTube watch history in a powerful, interactive wayâ€”just like a personal "YouTube Wrapped," but with the ability to ask any question you want!
It combines data extraction, semantic search, and large language models (LLMs) to answer both statistical and open-ended questions about your YouTube habits.
youtubewrapped.py: Extracts and processes your YouTube watch history from Google Takeout, and generates text embeddings for each video using Gemini.
queryproc.py: Lets you ask questions about your history (e.g., "Top 5 channels in 2023", "What did I watch about AI?", "Total videos in 2022") and uses LLMs and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer.
